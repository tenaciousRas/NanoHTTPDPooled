Adaptations to NanoHTTPD for easier subclassing.  NanoHTTPD is a simple HTTP server written in Java that's suitable for Android apps.

NanoHTTPDPooled provides a simple HTTP connection pool per the recommendation at http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Networking/Webserver/.  The intent is to offload the overhead involved in thread management from time-of-request to time-of-instantiation.
